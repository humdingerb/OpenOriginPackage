for [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org)

'_Open Origin Package_' is a Tracker Add-On that finds the package(s) of any selected file(s) and opens it in the preferred application.  
By default that is HaikuDepot where you could uninstall the package, or look at its description or the 'Contents' tab to see what other files are part of that package and where they are.

In case files did not belong to any package, you're informed by an alert:

### Building and installing

A simple '_make_' will build the add-on. A following '_make bindcatalogs_' will add the localized strings.  
To be able to use '_Open Origin Package_', copy it to _/system/non-packaged/add-ons/Tracker/_

'_Open Origin Package_' is also available from HaikuDepot.
